## :alien: Whats the weather like up there?
Its december in England. Wouldn't it be nice to see a different type of weather? Lets simulate some real martian weather! Using data from [NASA's public API](https://api.nasa.gov/) from the [InSight mission](https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/) this project will control a [WiFi enabled colour LED smart bulb from LIFX](https://lifxshop.eu/products/lifx-colour-a60-b22) to bring home the weather on mars.
